# Pentesting Basics

These notes cover the fundamentals of penetration testing.
The focus is on understanding the process, mindset,
and rules — not on illegal actions or exploitation.

All activities must be authorized and legal.

---

## 1. What Is Penetration Testing

Penetration testing (pentesting) is a controlled security assessment.

Goal:
- find security weaknesses
- understand real-world risk
- help improve defenses

Pentesting simulates attacker behavior
in a legal and agreed-upon scope.

---

## 2. Pentesting vs Hacking

Pentesting:
- authorized
- scoped
- documented
- focused on risk reduction

Hacking:
- unauthorized
- illegal
- no defined scope
- focused on damage or gain

Authorization is the key difference.

---

## 3. Scope and Rules of Engagement

Before testing starts, scope must be defined.

Scope defines:
- what systems can be tested
- what techniques are allowed
- time limits
- reporting requirements

Testing outside scope is not allowed.

---

## 4. Pentesting Phases (High-Level)

Typical pentesting phases:
1. Information Gathering
2. Enumeration
3. Vulnerability Identification
4. Validation
5. Reporting

Each phase builds on the previous one.

---

## 5. Information Gathering

Information gathering collects data about the target.

Examples:
- domains
- IP addresses
- services
- technologies

Good recon reduces guesswork later.

---

## 6. Enumeration

Enumeration is deeper discovery.

Examples:
- discovering endpoints
- identifying versions
- mapping functionality

Enumeration turns surface data
into actionable understanding.

---

## 7. Vulnerabilities vs Exploits

A vulnerability is a weakness.
An exploit is a way to abuse that weakness.

Pentesting focuses on:
- identifying vulnerabilities
- proving impact safely

Not every vulnerability needs exploitation.

---

## 8. Proof of Concept (PoC)

A PoC demonstrates that a vulnerability is real.

A good PoC:
- is minimal
- avoids damage
- proves impact
- stays within scope

PoCs are not full attacks.

---

## 9. Common Pentesting Targets

Typical targets:
- web applications
- APIs
- internal networks
- authentication mechanisms
- access control logic

Logic flaws are often more critical than technical bugs.

---

## 10. Tools in Pentesting

Tools assist testing but do not replace understanding.

Examples:
- intercepting proxies
- scanners
- manual testing tools

Tools help observe behavior,
but decisions are made by the tester.

---

## 11. Manual vs Automated Testing

Automated testing:
- fast
- broad coverage
- noisy

Manual testing:
- slower
- deeper
- better at logic issues

Effective pentesting combines both.

---

## 12. Reporting

Reporting is one of the most important phases.

A good report includes:
- clear description of issues
- impact explanation
- reproduction steps
- remediation guidance

If it is not reported clearly,
the finding has no value.

---

## 13. Ethics and Responsibility

Pentesters must:
- follow scope
- protect data
- avoid unnecessary damage
- act professionally

Trust is critical in security testing.

---

## Key Takeaways

- pentesting is authorized security testing
- scope defines what is allowed
- recon and enumeration are critical
- vulnerabilities are not the same as exploits
- PoCs should be minimal and safe
- tools support, not replace, skill
- reporting is as important as testing
