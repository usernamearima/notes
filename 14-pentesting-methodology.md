# Pentesting Methodology

These notes describe a structured penetration testing methodology.
The focus is on process, discipline, and repeatability.
All activities must be authorized and legal.

## 1. Purpose of a Methodology

A methodology provides:
- consistency
- repeatability
- clear scope control
- defensible results

Without a methodology, testing becomes random and incomplete.

---

## 2. Pre-Engagement and Scoping

Before any testing:
- define scope
- define objectives
- define timelines
- define allowed techniques

Key questions:
- what systems are in scope?
- what is explicitly out of scope?
- is testing authenticated or unauthenticated?
- how should findings be reported?

No testing should start without written authorization.

---

## 3. Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)

Goal:
- understand the target environment

Activities may include:
- identifying domains and IP ranges
- discovering technologies
- mapping exposed services
- understanding application structure

Reconnaissance reduces guesswork later.

---

## 4. Enumeration

Enumeration builds on reconnaissance.

Focus:
- endpoints
- parameters
- users and roles
- versions and configurations

Enumeration turns surface information
into detailed knowledge.

---

## 5. Threat Modeling (Lightweight)

At this stage, think like an attacker.

Ask:
- what assets are valuable?
- where is trust assumed?
- what roles exist?
- what could go wrong?

This helps prioritize testing effort.

---

## 6. Vulnerability Identification

Goal:
- identify weaknesses

This includes:
- configuration issues
- logic flaws
- access control problems
- insecure defaults

Not all vulnerabilities require exploitation.

---

## 7. Validation and Proof of Concept

Validation confirms that a vulnerability is real.

A Proof of Concept (PoC):
- is minimal
- proves impact
- avoids damage
- stays within scope

PoCs are demonstrations, not full attacks.

---

## 8. Privilege and Impact Assessment

Assess:
- what level of access was achieved
- what data could be accessed
- what actions could be performed

Impact matters more than technical complexity.

---

## 9. Chaining Issues (Conceptual)

Sometimes low-risk issues combine into high impact.

Examples:
- information disclosure + access control flaw
- weak authentication + excessive permissions

Methodology encourages looking for chains,
not isolated bugs.

---

## 10. Documentation During Testing

Document continuously:
- steps taken
- requests made
- responses observed
- assumptions tested

Good notes prevent confusion during reporting.

---

## 11. Reporting

Reporting is a core phase, not an afterthought.

A good report includes:
- clear issue description
- business impact
- reproduction steps
- remediation guidance
- evidence (screenshots, logs)

Reports must be understandable
to both technical and non-technical audiences.

---

## 12. Post-Engagement Review

After testing:
- review findings
- answer client questions
- clarify risk
- support remediation

Learning from each engagement
improves future testing.

---

## Key Principles

- methodology ensures quality
- scope defines legality
- recon and enumeration are foundational
- impact is more important than novelty
- documentation enables reporting
- professionalism builds trust
