# Malware Basics

These notes cover the fundamentals of malware.
The focus is on understanding types, behavior,
and security impact — not creating or using malware.

## 1. What Is Malware

Malware is malicious software designed to:
- disrupt systems
- steal data
- gain unauthorized access
- spy on users

Malware runs without the user's informed consent.

---

## 2. Why Malware Exists

Malware is created to:
- make money
- steal information
- gain persistence
- disrupt services
- support larger attacks

Motivation can be:
- financial
- political
- espionage
- experimentation

---

## 3. Common Malware Types

### Virus
- attaches to legitimate files
- spreads when the file is executed
- requires user action

---

### Worm
- self-propagates
- spreads automatically over networks
- does not require user interaction

---

### Trojan
- disguised as legitimate software
- relies on user execution
- opens access for attackers

---

### Ransomware
- encrypts files
- demands payment for recovery
- targets availability

---

### Spyware
- secretly monitors activity
- steals credentials or data
- focuses on confidentiality

---

### Adware
- displays unwanted advertisements
- may track user behavior
- often bundled with software

---

## 4. Malware Delivery Methods

Common delivery methods:
- phishing emails
- malicious attachments
- infected downloads
- compromised websites
- removable media (USB)

Most infections start with user interaction.

---

## 5. Malware Execution

Malware executes when:
- a file is opened
- a script is run
- a vulnerability is triggered

Execution may lead to:
- persistence
- lateral movement
- data exfiltration

---

## 6. Persistence Mechanisms

Persistence allows malware to survive reboots.

Examples:
- startup programs
- scheduled tasks
- registry modifications
- system services

Persistence makes removal harder.

---

## 7. Malware and Privileges

Malware may run as:
- normal user
- administrator
- system-level process

Higher privileges mean:
- more control
- more damage
- harder detection

---

## 8. Malware Detection (High-Level)

Malware can be detected using:
- antivirus software
- behavior analysis
- signature-based detection
- heuristics

Modern malware often tries to evade detection.

---

## 9. Malware Analysis (Conceptual)

Malware analysis aims to understand:
- what the malware does
- how it spreads
- what systems it affects

Analysis is performed in:
- isolated environments
- virtual machines
- sandboxes

Never analyze malware on a real system.

---

## 10. Malware Impact on Security

Malware can affect:
- confidentiality (data theft)
- integrity (data modification)
- availability (ransomware)

Malware incidents often lead to:
- data breaches
- service downtime
- financial loss

---

## Key Takeaways

- malware is malicious software
- different types serve different goals
- delivery often relies on user action
- persistence increases impact
- privilege level matters
- analysis requires isolation
- malware affects all CIA principles
